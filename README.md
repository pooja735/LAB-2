## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **MongoDB Connection Error**
   - Ensure MongoDB is running
   - Check connection string in `server.js`
   - Verify MongoDB is accessible on port 27017

2. **Port Already in Use**
   - Change the port in `server.js`
   - Kill existing processes on the port
   - Use `npm run dev` for automatic port management

3. **Frontend Build Errors**
   - Clear node_modules and reinstall: `rm -rf node_modules && npm install`
   - Check Node.js version compatibility
   - Ensure all dependencies are installed

4. **Large Number Calculations**
   - Some operations may take time for very large numbers
   - Use reasonable bit lengths for demonstrations
   - Consider browser limitations for client-side calculations
